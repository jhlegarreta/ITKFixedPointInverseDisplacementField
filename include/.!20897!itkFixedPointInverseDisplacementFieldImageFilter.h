/** \class FixedPointInverseDisplacementFieldImageFilter
 * \brief Computes the inverse of a Displacement field using a fixed point iteration scheme.
 *
 * FixedPointInverseDisplacementFieldImageFilter takes a Displacement field as input and
 * computes the Displacement field that is its inverse. If the input Displacement
 * field was mapping coordinates from a space A into a space B, the output of
 * this filter will map coordinates from the space B into the space A.
 *
 * To compute the inverse of the given Displacement field, the fixed point algorithm by
 * Mingli Chen, Weiguo Lu, Quan Chen, Knneth J. Ruchala and Gusavo H. Olivera
 * described in the paper
 * "A simple fixed-point approach to invert a Displacement field",
 * Medical Physics, vol. 35, issue 1, p. 81,
 * is applied.
